# TennisCardGame
This is a python implementation of the two player card game [Tennis](https://etgdesign.com/games/tennis/).

To play, clone the repository and run `python Tennis.py`. This will simulator one randomly played trick. In the future I will implement multiple tricks with changing trump suits, a human player option, a non-machine learning based AI, statistical analysss of the game, and possible a strategy guide.
