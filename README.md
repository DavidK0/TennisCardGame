# TennisCardGame
This is a python implementation of the two player card game [Tennis](https://etgdesign.com/games/tennis/). Tennis is essentially a two-player version of [Contact Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge). The main difference is that players strive to match their bids for tricks in each of their two hands, their forehand and their backhand.

To train a model, use main.py. To evaluate one or two models, use Evaluate.py. To challange a model yourself, use Play.py.

The best leader model I have trained so far can beat a random dealer 90% of the time.
